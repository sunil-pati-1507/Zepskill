# Weather App Setup Guide

Please follow these steps to run your Weather App project without any errors:

## Get Your Free API Key
1. Sign up for an account at [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx).
2. Navigate to the [API key](https://www.weatherapi.com/my) section and get your API key.

## Insert Your API Key
1. Open your project folder in VS Code.
2. Locate the `.env` file in your project.
3. Find the `VITE_API_KEY` variable and replace `YOUR-API-KEY-HERE` with your actual API key.

Note: Your API key will look something like this: c361b273c4304b3107f91953241109 

## Save and Test
1. Save the `.env` file after adding your API key.
2. Open the VS Code terminal by pressing `Ctrl + J` and run the following commands:
    `npm install` This command will install the necessary dependencies.
    `npm run dev` This command will start the local development server.

Click on the `localhost` link that appears in the terminal to open the project in your browser and get the weather data.
